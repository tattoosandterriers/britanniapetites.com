            <font face="Georgia">In my years of showing Brits, I have seen a 
            variety of approaches on how to handle these active animals. 
            Although some of the most unique strategies have come from judges. I 
            have seen everything from a compact pose, similar to that of the 
            Netherland Dwarf to dangling them from the tips of their ears. Also, 
            such comments as “Sharp Teeth” or “Excellent Jumper” are not that 
            infrequent and do not bother me, but like any other breed that is 
            supposed to be posed, whether flat on the table or up on its feet, 
            an exhibitor should become dissatisfied with the judge’s opinion 
            when their animal is not properly posed. In this article, I will 
            help you become more confident and knowledgeable in posing and 
            handling these sprightly two-pound rabbits. </font></p>
            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            &nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            <font face="Georgia">First off, a judge has to realize that Brits 
            are extremely intelligent and genetically high-strung animals that 
            have a lot of energy to burn. Knowing this, it is also essential to 
            understand the ideal type the Standard of Perfection describes for 
            Brits. Even though they are described at times as miniature Belgian 
            Hares, nothing could come farther from the truth. As a full-arched 
            breed, when properly posed and viewed from the side, a straight 
            continuous line should be formed from the top of the ears, through 
            the head and chest, and down through the front legs. A Brit should 
            pose with its forefeet fully extended on the tips of the toes. The 
            topline is to resemble a quarter circle and should not spoiled by 
            flat shoulders or protruding pin bones. Their belly is to be well 
            tucked up and reveal plenty of daylight. In ideal position, the 
            distance between the front feet and the hind feet should not exceed 
            two inches, otherwise the animal is being stretched out and 
            essentially distorting the topline. A Brit can never be posed too 
            high or never have too much extension of limb. Please remember, a 
            Brit should be posed with its hindquarters resting just slightly off 
            of the table. When you strictly focus on these aspects, their body 
            type can be compared to the lower case ‘h’. A properly posed Brit, 
            when viewed from the front, should display a somewhat narrow chest 
            that gradually broadens down the flanks into a well-rounded 
            hindquarter. On the contrary, an incorrectly posed Brit will distort 
            the assets of a great animal and may even improve the 
            characteristics of a poor example of the breed. So be on the look 
            out for undercut and pinched animals as it is a highly missed and a 
            very prominent breed fault. All in all, the overlying theme involved 
            when judging rabbits, especially Brits is the phrase properly posed.</font></p>

            <font face="Georgia">Due to the irregularity of this breed at shows, 
            a judge should not be faulted for at times being unfamiliar in 
            handling the breed. Being an educator, I know that one of the best 
            ways to learn about a breed is by getting your hands on them and 
            often. Since most judges do not raise them, the breeders have to be 
            the educators and each judge should take advantage of these 
            opportunities by utilizing their animals as hands-on resources. Many 
            exhibitors would be more than willing to spend time after judging or 
            on an off day to further educate a judge about this breed they 
            adore. <br>
            Since Brits are posed by many different methods, you as a judge have 
            to be able to be versatile and patient with each animal to find out 
            which method each animal reacts to best. There are three main types 
            of posing that are popular with Brit breeders, although, some are 
            safer than others. Two of which are described and illustrated in the 
            standard. <br>
            The first, safest and preferred method is called the shoulder lift. 
            Begin by having the Brit’s side facing you. Then place your dominant 
            hand just behind and under the shoulders. If you are doing this 
            correctly you will be able to manipulate the Brit’s front limbs with 
            your thumb and forefinger as if you were its marionette. Make sure 
            you have a light, but controlling grip, so that the animal does not 
            back up or slide out. You can even use your free hand to keep them 
            from flying off the table. Now lightly and gently start raising the 
            Brit’s forequarter until the front legs are fully extended and in 
            line with the eye and ear. Be sure to loosen and lighten your grip 
            with each positive reaction to the lift. Finish the pose by making 
            sure the animal’s ears meet all the way up. Brits generally like 
            their backs to be stoked and this combined with gentle persuasion to 
            lift their front legs into the required position helps to reassure 
            and relax them. This method works excellent for animals that have 
            been worked with a great deal. More experienced judges may even use 
            their free hand to pose another animal in this same manner allowing 
            them to evaluate both specimens simultaneously. </font></p>
            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            &nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            <font face="Georgia">The second, a more controlling pose is called 
            the chin lift. Start off with the animal facing you. Place your hand 
            over the Brit’s back and your thumb under its chin. You should place 
            your free hand on the hindquarters to prevent the Brit from backing 
            up. Begin raising the forequarter of the animal off the table with 
            your thumb until the front legs are fully extended and form a 
            straight line with the eye and ear. If the Brit continually tries to 
            move backwards try lightly tapping its rear end with your fingers. 
            Because of the control this method provides you, it tends to work 
            well with temperamental or young animals.</font></p>

            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            <font face="Georgia">The third, commonly seen, but less effective on 
            the inexperienced Brit is called the praying lift. Begin with the 
            animal facing you and cup your hands around the animal as if you 
            were praying. With your thumbs extended begin lightly raising the 
            forequarter of the animal off the table with your palms in a rolling 
            motion until the front legs are fully extended and create a 
            continuous line with the eye and ear. An alternative option will be 
            to nudge the sides of the animal with the ball of each hand into 
            position. Some of the animals will strike up into the pose, while 
            others will need a lot more prompting. It might also help to press 
            your abdomen towards the animal, as it will typically cause them to 
            want to back up. Since you have control of the Brit it will not back 
            up, but instead strike a pose. The main downfall is your wrists are 
            easy targets for nibbling from those assertive Brits. I have even 
            seen a few animals jump straight up, right into the judge’s face, so 
            beware that this can happen. I must note that I have exhibited under 
            judges whom have mastered this method of handling and it is quite 
            beneficial not only for the judge and animals, but also those 
            observing the judge. </font></p>

            <font face="Georgia">Are you still a little unsure? This next 
            section is aimed to help prevent mistakes or reoccurring problems 
            and simply give advice. When Brits are called to your table you have 
            to remember to be patient. As stated before these little guys can be 
            temperamental, but it has been my experience that they do behave at 
            shows, for the most part. Try not to make any sudden movements and 
            be sure to use a softer voice when judging them. Make note of where 
            the animal is at all times and more importantly where your hands are 
            in relation to this animal. Again, it is recommended that you use a 
            controlling, yet gentle touch when handling them. As stated in the 
            standard, Brits should never be allowed to run free and most of all 
            never be pushed down on the table. If forced down you have most 
            likely ruined your chances of getting them to pose. Also, do not use 
            their ears as a means to make them pose. If this actually worked it 
            would be written in the standard. If you happen to become frustrated 
            with an animal or vice versa and have other Brits to judge, place it 
            in one of the holding coops and come back to it. For the novice 
            judge this allows them to watch the Brits show off their extension 
            in a more comfortable setting. Brits tend to pose best when they are 
            a little on edge. To get a Brit to stick its pose, simply apply a 
            little bit of pressure with your fingers at the base of its ears 
            while in pose. Then gently stroke the back of the ears in an upward 
            motion to put the ears into position and to calm the animal. You can 
            also run your thumb along their jaw line, but be aware not to touch 
            their whiskers as this may disrupt their pose. On an ending note, be 
            aware that after working with them and giving them the opportunity 
            to pose, they should only be mildly faulted if they fail to do so, 
            just like any other posed breed. Brits are not circus animals and 
            only need to hold the fully upright position for a couple seconds.

            <font face="Georgia">Although these are just a few pointers from a 
            breeder’s perspective, I truly believe that with patience and proper 
            handling, a judge with little prompting should be able to get a 
            trained Brit to pose naturally. Brits are natural showmen and when 
            encouraged to sit up generally do so. Brits are fairly easy to 
            judge. Typically the breeder will spend more time working with their 
            better animals. Thus then, these animals should pose with little to 
            no assistance. Now this is not always the norm, but generally an 
            exhibitor will enter their best animals that are not only in coat, 
            but also pose readily. Very few breeds when put on the table can 
            stop an onlooker in their tracks. The Britannia Petite is one such 
            breed, but sadly in contrast has a poor reputation in the rabbit 
            world. I have complete confidence that if you truly respect the 
            breed and practice when you have the opportunity, you will do a 
            great job. </font></p>
