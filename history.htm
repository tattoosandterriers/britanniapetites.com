            Britannia Petite originated in England and is known there as the 
            Polish. When they were brought to the United States and accepted by 
            the American Rabbit Breeders Association they were given the name 
            Britannia Petites as there was already a recognized breed known by 
            the name Polish. In England colored Petites have been shown with the 
            Ruby Eyed Whites for many years. Originally, the American Rabbit 
            Breeders Association only recognized the Ruby Eyed White, but since 
            that time has accepted the Black Otter, Chestnut Agouti, Black, Sable Marten, Broken and Blue Eyed White. </font>

            <p style="margin-right: 25"><font face="Georgia">Many dedicated 
            breeders are working hard to insure that the Britannia Petites 
            become a strong influence in the rabbit world. <br>
            <br>
            The Britannia Petites are a very old breed, and at one time they 
            were near the point of extinction, but a few dedicated breeders were 
            able to save these sprightly little rabbits from extinction. The 
            Britannia Petites were once a much larger animal than they are now. 
            The ideal weight of the Britannia Petite is 2 1/4 pounds, fully 
            grown. They are one of the smallest breeds of domestic rabbits.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="bpEscape.jpg" align="right" width="221" height="300">The Britannia 
            Petites are sprightly upright little show offs. With patience and 
            proper handling, a judge experienced in handling Britannia Petites 
            should be able to get the animal to pose naturally. However, after 
            working with them and giving them the opportunity to show themselves 
            in an upright pose, they should only be mildly faulted if they fail 
            to do so. Because they are an active rabbit by nature, they do not 
            require much prodding to show off. They require a lot of handling 
            and table training to ready them for show presentation. A commitment 
            of time and patience is required to guide one of these lovely 
            animals to show themselves off to their best advantage. <br>
            <br>
            One of the first things you hear about the Britannia Petites is, 
            “how pretty but aren't they mean little rabbits?”. They have earned 
            somewhat of an unjust reputation from a few of the wild and seldom 
            handled specimens being shown. The Britannia Petite is a naturally 
            high strung animal that is very lively and very intelligent. 
            Consequently, they require a patient attitude on your part to 
            successfully work with them. A responsive and interacting 
            relationship is a must if you want to enjoy this active little 
            rabbit.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="bpshow4.jpg" align="left" width="297" height="216">When the does are in 
            heat and ready to breed, they can become very aggressive as can 
            bucks intent on breeding.. Most new mothers are very protective of 
            their young and resent intrusions, especially from a stranger. This 
            is a common practice for most breeds of domestic rabbit, but the 
            high strung nature of the Britannia Petites with their quickness and 
            agility can sometimes require special attention in order to perform 
            your usual cage duties. A small treat sometimes will distract the 
            doe temporarily, allowing you to check the nest quietly and easily.<br>
            <br>
            Young Britannia Petites, with careful handling and a reassuring tone 
            of voice soon become very responsive to your wishes. They have an 
            abundance of energy, which when redirected properly should allow you 
            to be able to handle them without fear for your fingers. In short 
            treat them right and you'll reap the reward of having a unique 
            little rabbit that is awed by most who see them. Once they have 
            become used to your handling, they may be trained to assume the show 
            pose. This requires patience and repetitive placement for short 
            periods every day. Praise them when they do well and soon they will 
            eagerly perform for you.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="bpshow5.jpg" align="right" width="251" height="250">Housing for the 
            Britannia Petite, doesn't need to be overly large or extravagant. If 
            kept in a cage too large, they can easily be startled, sometimes 
            even resulting in injury. I have found the ideal size cage for Does 
            to be 18" W X 24" D X 14" H . I keep my Bucks in cages 18" D X 18" W 
            X 14" H...they seem to feel more secure in a smaller cage. I have 
            found that if you can get floor wire that is 1/2" X 1/2" instead of 
            the standard 1/2" X 1" , the baby Britannia Petites have less 
            trouble moving around in the cage, and being so tiny I have seen 
            them break a leg if they get startled. Some breeders use solid 
            bottom cages, constructed of wood, but you should consider one very 
            important factor...cage cleaning... if you use wooden bottoms you 
            will have a lot more cleaning to do. <br>
            <br>
            </font><img border="0" src="bpshow6.jpg" align="left" width="248" height="291"><font face="Georgia">Feed 
            Requirements are the same as most other domestic rabbits as quality 
            of feed is very important. I have found they do well on rabbit 
            pellets, oats and hay. Using 1/3 to 1/2 measuring cup of pellets a 
            day should be adequate, and adjust it accordingly to each individual 
            rabbit, more if it's a doe with a litter. Of course they do a little 
            better with a variety of treats such as alfalfa cubes, shredded 
            wheat biscuits, cheerios breakfast cereal, dry toast, carrots, green 
            leafy vegetables. Be very careful when giving them treats as changes 
            in their diet can cause digestive upsets. Plenty of fresh water is a 
            mandatory requirement with any breed of rabbit.<br>
            <br>
            The Britannia Petites are a fascinating little rabbit which provide 
            an interesting challenge. Sleek and stylish, independent and alert, 
            they are truly a "fancier's fancy", deserving the title the "Elite 
            of the Fancy". Britannia Petites are not for everyone, but with 
            perseverance and patience, they will reward your time and effort, 
            providing you with an eye catching show animal. Watching this little 
            rabbit respond to your training and handling is well worth it. It is 
            truly a sight to see when you have a Britannia Petite hold the show 
            pose as if it were a statue.</font><p align="center">
