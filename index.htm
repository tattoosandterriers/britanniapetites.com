            <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">The American Britannia 
            Petite originated in England and is known there as the Polish. When 
            they were brought to the United States and accepted by the American 
            Rabbit Breeders Association they were given the name Britannia 
            Petite as there was already a recognized breed known by the name 
            Polish. In England colored Petites have been shown with the Ruby 
            Eyed Whites for many years. Originally, the American Rabbit Breeders 
            Association only recognized the Ruby Eyed White, but since that time 
            has accepted the Black, Black Otter, Blue Eyed White, Broken, Chestnut Agouti, and Sable 
            Marten. <br>
            <br>
            There are 7 showable varieties......Black, Black Otter, Blue Eyed White, Broken, Chestnut 
            Agouti, Ruby Eyed White and Sable Marten.</span></font></p>

            <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">The Britannia Petite is a 
            very old breed, and at one time they were near the point of 
            extinction, but a few dedicated breeders were able to save these 
            sprightly little rabbits. Britannia Petites were 
            once a much larger animal than they are now. The ideal weight of the 
            Britannia Petite is 2 1/4 pounds fully grown. They are one of the 
            smallest breeds of domestic rabbits.<br>
            <br>
            The Britannia Petites are sprightly, upright little show offs. With 
            patience and proper handling, a judge experienced in handling 
            Britannia Petites should be able to get the animal to pose 
            naturally. However, after working with them and giving them the 
            opportunity to show themselves in an upright pose, they should only 
            be mildly faulted if they fail to do so. Because they are an active 
            rabbit by nature, they do not require much prodding to show off. 
            They require a lot of handling and table training to ready them for 
            show presentation. A commitment of time and patience is required to 
            guide one of these lovely animals to show themselves off to their 
            best advantage. </span></font></p>
