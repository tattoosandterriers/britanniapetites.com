            <font face="Georgia">Britannia Petite exhibitors are a small, but 
            select group of dedicated breeders. It is very disheartening to see 
            the vast inconsistencies in the judging of Britannia Petites. Be it 
            lack of knowledge or simple disregard for the standard, Petites are 
            not being evaluated in an equitable manner. In an effort to offer a 
            little assistance in this area, I will attempt to explain.<br>
            <br>
            One considerable oversight committed in judging Petites is evident 
            in the selection of the large, wide-hipped, heavily-boned animals. 
            Most of these larger animals pose wonderfully, and therefore impress 
            judges. I have seen animals of this type make the cut all the way to 
            Best of Breed. I realize that posing is necessary for the best 
            evaluation, but this alone should not be the determining factor in 
            choosing a good Petite. Britannia Petites are to be as the name 
            implies, petite. They should not be huge, non-dwarf horses with 
            hooves, or have small pig eyes, or ears between which one could 
            drive a truck. Large Petites are not Petites for the show room, they 
            are culls. Neither the exhibitor nor the breed gains with the high 
            placing of these larger, non-dwarf type animals. Rather, the breed, 
            as a whole suffers.<br>
            <br>
            Petites are a fully arched animal. The arch starts at the neck (the 
            neck should appear as miniscule as possible--almost nonexistent) and 
            should be a smooth continual curve from the neck to the tail base. 
            The body, when viewed from the side, is to show a good amount of 
            daylight, so to speak, from the belly to the table. Viewed from the 
            top, one should see a slight taper in the body from the shoulders to 
            the hips. This does not mean that the hips of a Petite should be 
            wide. A well-balanced Petite is one that has a very minimal widening 
            of the hips, not one that has hips twice the size of the shoulders. 
            Slightly wider does not mean broad. Petites are not meat producers. 
            Obviously it would be nice if the pin bones were well covered in 
            flesh, but severely faulting a Petite for protruding pin bones is 
            not appropriate. A Petite can have rough hips and still be balanced. 
            Wide or large hipped Petites are not balanced.<br>
            <br>
            The Petites head is to be wedge-shaped. This means that it should 
            not be rounded like the head of a dwarf. A wedge could be defined as 
            a triangular shape with an angle similar to a 1/8 to 1/4 piece of 
            pie. One should be realistic and think of balance. A long-legged, 
            long-eared, long-bodied animal would sport a head that is long and 
            narrow also. Balance is the key. A well-balanced, wedge-shaped head 
            with the addition of large bold eyes will give the proper wedge 
            shape naturally. The eyes make up the widest part of the wedge. 
            Proper bold Petite eyes will give a concave appearance to the middle 
            of the forehead, resembling those of an alligator, thus the 
            expression, “...eye like an alligator.” The eyes are very important. 
            If the rabbit has small pig eyes, the head will not have a good 
            wedge shape.<br>
            <br>
            Petite ears, when viewed from the front, are to be held close 
            together in an upright position. Flanges should not be visible. Ears 
            should be held tightly together with nary any daylight visible. Ear 
            tips are to be rounded with substantial substance, not paper thin. 
            Ears should be set on the head in a manner that gives the appearance 
            of balance, they should not be wide spread. They should sit upright 
            in a very stiff stance.<br>
            <br>
            A Petites front feet should be as narrow and as in-line (straight) 
            with the legs as possible. Toes are not to flare out, nor should 
            they present they appearance of hooves. Small narrow Petite feet are 
            to be connected to fine boned straight front legs. The hind feet are 
            to be in line with the body, not cow hocked. Ideally, the hind feet 
            are to hold the body off the ground.<br>
            <br>
            I will only touch base on handling and posing, as there are numerous 
            methods, and to cover all would take too much space. First and 
            foremost, please do not use the rabbits’ ears as a means to pose 
            them. The ear grabbing technique only serves to make most Britannia 
            Petites crouch down, and certainty prompts them to pull away and 
            refuse to hold their ears upright. After one has the animal posed, 
            it is permissible and sometimes helpful to stoke or tap the ears on 
            the back side. However, unless one feels confident that one knows 
            how to do this, it is better to leave the ears alone. There is 
            another important item to be mentioned in a discussion of Petite 
            judging. Petites are not to run on the table. Petite breeders do not 
            spend hours training a Petite to pose and take them to a show only 
            to have an unknowing judge run them up and down the table. A judge 
            should be able to see if the animal has bad legs when the animal is 
            picked up and turned over for the initial examination. Petites are 
            not scored on their tracking abilities, the reason being that a 
            Petite free to run wherever is a Petite out of control. They will 
            leap in the air, sometimes jumping off the table, with absolutely no 
            regard for their own safety. Broken legs, toes or worse can happen. 
            Judging the Petite is more time consuming than some breeds, but when 
            the animals are well-behaved and trained to pose, Petite judging is 
            a pleasure, not a chore.<br>
