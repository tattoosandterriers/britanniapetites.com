            <font face="Georgia">Body type is the most important factor in the 
            Britannia Petite breed. There is, I think, a tendency to judge 
            Britannia Petites as if they were miniature Belgian Hares; nothing, 
            however, could be further from the truth. A good Britannia Petite is 
            a bit more compact in body type than a Belgian Hare, with a 
            wedge-shaped head and a shorter, rounder ear. These two breeds 
            should resemble each other only in their fineness of bone and their 
            striking pose.</font></p>

            <font face="Georgia">Britannia Petites are a full-arched breed. When 
            properly posed, the arch should start at the base of the neck--not 
            behind the shoulders--and continue down, in a smooth, unbroken line, 
            to the base of the tail. The arch should not be spoiled by 
            protruding hip or pin bones. In other words, when viewed in profile, 
            the back should be round, like a quarter circle. The belly of the 
            Britannia Petite should be well tucked up. This means that, when 
            properly posed, the &quot;line of the abdomen&quot; should start where the 
            front legs join the body and form another smaller quarter circle 
            from the chest to the pelvis. A properly posed Britannia Petite, 
            when viewed from the front, should display a somewhat narrow chest 
            that broadens gradually down the flanks to a well-rounded 
            hindquarter. A good Britannia Petite should NOT be undercut, and 
            this is a very prominent breed fault that is seldom commented on.<br>
            Eyes carry 15 points, and so are the second most important factor 
            when judging a Britannia Petite. The eyes should be round and VERY 
            bold, almost to the point where they seem to bulge right out of the 
            head. Many of the whites that I have judged are much too pale in eye 
            color. Their eyes should be a deep ruby-red all over, not pale pink.</font></p>

            <font face="Georgia">Head, ears, and feet and legs carry 10 points 
            each. The head of a good Britannia Petite should be wedge-shaped! 
            When judging Britannia Petites, be sure to note the length of the 
            head between the eyes and the nose. Many Britannia Petites are too 
            long in head and too snipey through the muzzle. A wedge-shaped head 
            is a bit short and nicely tapered. It should not resemble that of a 
            Netherland Dwarf, but should have enough width between the eyes and 
            through the muzzle to give it a more balanced look.</font></p>

            <font face="Georgia">The ears should balance with the head, body, 
            and legs. The tips of the ears should be nicely rounded, not 
            pointed. Remember that pointed tips can make the ears look longer 
            than they actually are. The ears should not be paper-thin; rather, 
            they should have some substance to them. They should be well set on 
            top of the head and should have a strong ear base. The ears should 
            touch all the way up from the ear base to the tip of the ear. There 
            should be no scissoring at the tips and no bowing! This will only be 
            achieved if the ears are of the correct shape and substance. The 
            ARBA Standard of Perfection calls for the ears to be well-furred. 
            This means that if you are judging a ruby-eyed white, the ears will 
            be white, not pink. Ears poorly covered with fur are a fault, and a 
            very common one at that.</font></p>

            <font face="Georgia">The feet and legs of the Britannia Petite are 
            to be STRAIGHT, SLENDER, and FINE-BONED. This holds true for the 
            hind feet as well as the front feet. If the hind feet appear to be 
            splayed outward, then the animal is either undercut or improperly 
            posed. The front legs should be perfectly straight; they should not 
            bow AT ALL, but especially at the ankle. Be sure to stand back and 
            evaluate the animal's straightness of limb both from the front and 
            in profile. The front legs should be fine in bone. Many times, they 
            are not. On a good Britannia Petite, the front feet will be nearly 
            indistinguishable from the front leg. This is as it should be. These 
            animals display proper bone and straightness of leg. A Britannia 
            Petite should NOT appear to be wearing cowboy boots on its front 
            feet.</font></p>

            is SHORT, about 1/2 inch in length. It should be very dense and 
            somewhat fine in texture. A longer guard hair will give the coat a 
            harsher texture. This is very undesirable. A good Britannia Petite 
            coat will display a quick, snappy flyback; a rollback coat is a 
            disqualification.</font></p>

            should feel solid when handled and should be firm in flesh. Although 
            slender by nature, a good Britannia Petite will appear to &quot;feel&quot; 
            well-muscled. Protruding bones and soft, flabby flesh will do 
            nothing for the physical appearance of this striking little rabbit.</font></p>
